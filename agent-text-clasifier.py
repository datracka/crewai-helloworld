Bridging Technology and Business: Unlocking New Value for Clients

One of the great advantages of being independent is the freedom to experiment. 

I recently realized that focusing solely on technical solutions was like building a glass ceiling for myself. To truly enhance value, I needed to be intricately involved in the day-to-day business operations.

With this insight, for a recent project, instead of merely setting up a CRM and Customer Journey pipeline using tools like CG, BigQuery, Airflow, Segment, Hubspot, Python, NodeJS, or Java, I expanded my services to include a consultancy package. 

This wasn't just about building infrastructureâ€”it was about maximizing lead generation and conversion rates through tailored CRM consultancy!

This experience was enlightening. I discovered significant synergies between the technical and business aspects of the project. 

I am now convinced that mastering both domains provides a unique selling proposition for my clients, enabling me to deliver unparalleled service."
